# val_loss did not improve
	- epoches too small? batchsize:20 , trainsize:30000
	- right for many?
# k-fold not in use 
	- no see a example of cnn using k-fold
# more epoches will overfit?

# 2017-12-26-13-53
	- overfit after 20 epoches
	- many val_loss did not improve
	- need dropout ,more understanding
	- other kick overfiting?
	- bigger batchsie?
	- in fact more data is waiting(wrong understanding)
	- one epoch (batch size * number of iterations)
# 2017-12-26-6-57(floydhub)
	- 50 epoches, 40min
	- need more epoches
	- after enough epoches, model loss will be close to 0.7 which will determine the ultimate acc
# 2017-12-26-15-57
	- after 20 epoches overfit

# 2017-12-26-16-21
	- old model has no affect to the training

# 2017-12-26-16-52
	- train acc is lower than val acc!!!
	- I can't understand
	- dropout(0.5) 
	- first, you need high acc

# 2017-12-26-17-25
	- still too large dropout?
